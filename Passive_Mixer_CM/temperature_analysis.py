# =========================================== POST OPTIMIZATION TEMPERATURE ANALYSIS ========================================================
# The inputs to this operation are post optimization circuit parameters and simulation parameters for the Temperature analysis to be done
# At each input temperature, the function will analyse the following output specification of the mixer
#   1. gain over bandwidth for given flo
#   2. S11 over 2*bandwidth around centre frequency = given flo
#   3. integrated SSB Noise figure from 1K to bandwidth for given flo
#   4. iip3 - for 2 tones & flo specified by the user
#   5. 1-dB compression point
